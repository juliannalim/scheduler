## Description

Scheduler is an application that I made using React. It allows the user to book, edit, save and delete appointments for interviews. Each interview requires a time slot, the user's name and a interviewer. This is an useful application to help anyone or a business to schedule time. Feel free to clone this repo (You can have confidence in this code because I also spent three days learning to write test to make sure things wrote by using Cypress).
